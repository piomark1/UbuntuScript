That's improved environment setup script for HyperionDev BootCamp
Improvements include: 
  -extra command "sudo apt-get upadate && sudo apt-get install python3-pip" in line 10
  -in line 28; "core" was changed for "code"

Now this script suppose to be fine and working with Ubuntu 22.04.3LTS(For me did...)
